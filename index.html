    <br><br><br>
    <h2 class="subheading">1. Make sure you have the right diet</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Skincare isn't just about what you put on your skin, it's also about what you put in your body. If you don't have
        a healthy diet, it will show on your skin. Therefore, eating right will help your skin look its
        best.<br><br>These are the <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/4-best-vitamins-for-skin#vitamin-d">best
            vitamins for your skin:</a></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Vitamin A: Found in leafy green vegetables like kale and spinach, orange and yellow vegetables like carrots
            and sweet potatoes, fish, eggs, and cheese.</li> <br>
        <li>Vitamin B: Found in grains, nuts and legumes, meat, poultry, and fish.</li> <br>
        <li>Vitamin C: Found in citrus fruits like oranges, other fruits like strawberries and kiwis, red and green
            peppers, and tomatoes</li> <br>
        <li>Vitamin E: Found in green vegetables such as spinach and broccoli, nuts, and vegetable oils.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
        In addition, vitamin A aids in skin cell reproduction, and vitamin C is an antioxidant, which can provide extra
        protection for your skin.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 class="subheading">2. Cleanse regularly</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Cleansing regularly contributes to glowing skin by removing dead skin cells, dirt, and debris from the skin,
        which prevents the clogging of pores and dulling of skin, Campbell says. <br><br> You should wash your face with
        a gentle facial cleanser.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="subheading">3. Use topical vitamin C</h2>
    <br>
    <p>After you wash your face in the morning, <u>Campbell</u> says you should apply two to three drops of a topical
        vitamin C serum. As a bonus, she says vitamin C helps your sunscreen work better, which is why it's best to
        apply it in the morning rather than the evening. <br><br> Because of its antioxidant properties, Campbell says
        topical Vitamin C is known to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prevent brown spots and lightens pre-existing ones</li> <br>
        <li>Reduce skin redness</li> <br>
        <li>Help stimulate collagen, resulting in healthier skin tone and texture.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h2 class="subheading">The types of self-care routines</h2>
    <br>
    <p id="underline">Given Dr. Sacco’s relatively simple definition,</p>
    <p>it might seem that there are a lot of examples of what can pass for self-care. But he notes that there are a few
        specific examples that are relatively easy for anyone to follow. <br> When it comes to physical health, he
        includes the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Exercise</li><br>
        <li>Diet</li><br>
        <li>Sleep</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you’re wondering where to start, look for something that you’ve always wanted to do or maybe something you
        feel you need to do, like an exercise routine. And when you start, says Dr. Sacco, do so with very clear goals
        in mind, following the S-M-A-R-T concept:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>S</strong>pecific: Identify the details about your goals.</li><br>
        <li><strong>M</strong>easurable: Decide how progress will be measured.</li><br>
        <li><strong>A</strong>chievable: Set realistic goals.</li><br>
        <li><strong>R</strong>elevant: The change will make a difference.</li><br>
        <li><strong>T</strong>ime-bound: Set a realistic timeframe.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Whatever the case is for you, Dr. Sacco stresses that it’s important to adapt to a new routine instead of giving
        up. “Adapt to your new circumstances, reprioritize things and figure out that new routine. Sometimes you have to
        adjust along the way.”
